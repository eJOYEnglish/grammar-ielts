## 2. Executive Summary
### Problem Statement
Learners of English as a Second Language (ESL) often lack a clear, objective understanding of their specific grammar weaknesses. Generic quizzes often fail to provide actionable feedback in the learner's native language, leading to confusion and slower progress. Furthermore, learners struggle to find high-quality, targeted resources to address their specific gaps.

### Proposed Solution
The **Global English Grammar Diagnostic Tool** is a web-based assessment application that delivers a personalized 50-question grammar test pulled dynamically from a comprehensive Question Bank.
**Key differentiators:**
1.  **Strict Localization:** While the test content remains in English (to test proficiency), all instructions and *crucial* error explanations are provided in the user's native language (English, Vietnamese, Spanish, Chinese).
2.  **Diagnostic Feedback:** Immediate, detailed analysis of incorrect answers with rule explanations.
3.  **Actionable Pathways:** Direct linkage to premium learning resources ("Grammar for IELTS" & "eJOY").

### 10.2 Coverage Requirements

**Business Rule:** The 50 questions randomly selected from the Question Bank MUST:
1. Include exactly **TWO questions from each of the 25 grammar topics** listed above.
2. Ensure perfect distribution (2 questions per topic) for balanced assessment.
3. When the Question Bank expands beyond 50 items, the randomization algorithm must maintain topic diversity by selecting 2 distinct questions per topic.

### 10.3 Topic Distribution Strategy

**For MVP (Current 50-Question Fixed Set):**
- ✅ All 25 topics are currently covered in Questions 1-50
- ✅ Distribution is perfectly balanced with exactly 2 questions per topic
- ✅ All topics are equally weighted for diagnostic accuracy

**For Future Expansion (200+ Question Bank):**
- Implement structured random selection ensuring each of the 25 topics appears exactly twice
- Maintain exactly 2 questions per topic (50 ÷ 25 = 2)
